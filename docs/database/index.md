# Database Documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the database structure and configuration for the Prashil Foundation's education and financial services platform.

## Contents

1. [Table Structures](./tables.md)
2. [Indexes](./indexes.md)
3. [Triggers](./triggers.md)
4. [Policies](./policies.md)
5. [Constraints](./constraints.md)

## Overview

The database is designed to support the following core functionalities:

### User Management
- User authentication and profiles
- Admin user management
- Role-based access control

### Educational Services
- Course management
- Education guidance services
- College planning

### Financial Services
- Education loan services
- Fee structures
- Payment processing

### Communication
- User messages
- Admin responses
- Application tracking

## Implementation Features

- Secure user authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control with Row Level Security (RLS)
- Automated timestamp management
- Comprehensive data integrity constraints
- Secure encryption for sensitive data

## Technical Specifications

- Primary keys use UUID for all tables
- Timestamps use timestamptz for timezone awareness
- Email fields enforce uniqueness
- Automatic timestamp updates via triggers
- Row Level Security (RLS) for access control
- Type constraints for data consistency
- Referential integrity through foreign keys
- Secure password hashing and storage
- Audit trails for critical operations

## Best Practices

1. **Data Access**
   - Always use RLS policies for data access
   - Never bypass security policies
   - Use prepared statements for queries

2. **Data Modification**
   - Always update `updated_at` timestamps
   - Maintain referential integrity
   - Validate data before insertion

3. **Security**
   - Follow least privilege principle
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Regular security audits

4. **Performance**
   - Use indexes appropriately
   - Regular maintenance
   - Monitor query performance

## Maintenance Notes

- Regular backups are essential
- Monitor database size and growth
- Check and update indexes periodically
- Review and update security policies
- Monitor and optimize query performance
